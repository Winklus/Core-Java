public class TypesOfErrors {

  // * Types of errors... 1) Compiler errors, 2) Runtime errors, 3) Logical errors

  // * example of logical error when u add two number let say 2 + 2 and u get 5 as answer this kind of errors are known as logical errors. this mean their is a problem in ur logic.

  // * Compiler errors: this are errors that occurs when you run ur code, the compiler will tell you where the error is found and hence compiler error are easy to solve.


  // * Runtime error:  let say when u have a app that when a user login the user object is save in a hard drive and next time u try to login login the application check in the hard drive for the user before he can login. so mistakely someone delete every user in ur hard drive so when next u try to login the application crashes. example my experience with mern stack blog app....


  // * Runtime errors are calls Exceptions
